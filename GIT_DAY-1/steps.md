# Additional Notes
- **Organization**: A GitHub organization allows multiple users to collaborate on repositories. You can manage access and permissions for teams within the organization.
- **Teams**: Teams in an organization help group members based on their roles (e.g., `Developers`, `Designers`). Teams can have different levels of access to repositories.
- **Repository Permissions**: You can assign various levels of access to team members: **Read** (view access), **Write** (edit access), and **Admin** (full control).
- **Important**: Be cautious when deleting teams and repositories as these actions are permanent and cannot be undone.
